# RC6_Paper_Implementation

## This paper has the following
---
* Implementation of the RC6 algorithm as described in the paper -> [RC6 Implementation](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Rc6.pdf)
* There would be two versions of this paper. each version would have its own branch
* for each version, there would be there own test suites to test the vectors present in the Appendix of the paper.

## Desciption
---

* The code would take in binary input as described in the paper and output the values in binary format
* The version of this algorithm is RC6 32/20/b, i.e it works on 32 bit input for 20 rounds and the key length is variable.
